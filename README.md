Serial Studio is a multi-platform, versatile data visualization tool designed for embedded engineers, students, hackers, and teachers. It allows users to visualize, analyze, and represent data from their projects and devices without needing custom, project-specific visualization software. Serial Studio offers a flexible solution that adapts to a wide range of use cases, making it ideal for both educational and professional environments.

The tool was born out of my experience in multiple CanSat-based competitions, where I often found myself developing new Ground Station Software for each project. Over time, I realized it would be more efficient and sustainable to maintain a single, flexible Ground Station Software that allows users to define how incoming data is processed and displayed.

Today, Serial Studio is a powerful and adaptable tool, suitable not only for CanSat competitions but for any data acquisition and visualization project. It supports data retrieval from a wide range of sources, including hardware and software serial ports, MQTT, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and network sockets (TCP/UDP).

## Features

- **Cross-platform:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **CSV Export:** Easily saves received data in CSV files for further analysis or processing.
- **Support for multiple data sources:** Handles a wide variety of sources, including serial ports, MQTT, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and network sockets (TCP/UDP).
- **Customizable visualization:** Allows users to define and display data using various widgets, configurable via the project editor to meet specific needs.
- **Customizable frame analysis:** Provides the option to modify a JavaScript function to interpret incoming data frames, enabling the preprocessing of raw sensor data and handling of complex binary formats.
- **MQTT publishing and receiving:** Sends and receives data over the internet, enabling real-time data visualization from anywhere in the world.

## Installation

You can download and install the latest version of Serial Studio for your preferred platform from [here](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/releases/latest).

### Linux Installation

For GNU/Linux users, after downloading the AppImage, ensure it has the correct executable permissions before running the application:

```bash
chmod +x SerialStudio-2.1.0-Linux.AppImage
./SerialStudio-2.1.0-Linux.AppImage
```

Alternatively, you can integrate Serial Studio into your system using [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher/).

### Prebuilt Linux Packages

For Arch Linux users, you can install Serial Studio using the AUR:

```bash
aur fetch serial-studio-git
aur build
sudo pacman -S serial-studio-git
```

**Note:** The AUR package recipe may be outdated, so be sure to check for updates.

## Development

### Requirements

To compile Serial Studio, the only required dependency is [Qt](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/). The desktop application compiles with **Qt 6.7.1**.

If you're compiling on GNU/Linux, you’ll also need to install `libgl1-mesa-dev`:

```bash
sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev
```

Here’s the list of required Qt modules:

- Qt SVG
- Qt Quick
- Qt Widgets
- Qt Location
- Qt Bluetooth
- Qt Networking
- Qt Positioning
- Qt Serial Port
- Qt Print Support
- Qt Quick Widgets
- Qt Quick Controls 2

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository with the necessary submodules, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio
cd Serial-Studio
```

### Compiling the Application

Once Qt is installed, you can compile the project by opening the **CMakeLists.txt** file in your preferred IDE or by using the command line:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release -j 10
```

## Software Architecture
